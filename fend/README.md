# Front-end
<p>This frontend is loaded first using any desktop browser by reaching "/" and it displays a QR generated by the API.<br>
After scanning the QR with a mobile device the user will be redirected to another endpoint with an upload form input<br>
At this moment the device is sync with the desktop (a label appeared) and the user can send a picture.<br>
<br>A any moment both pages display somes messages received by sockets regarding synching and upload status </p>
