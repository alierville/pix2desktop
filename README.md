Sync Desktop to mobile device to send picture from it

<p>
The main idea is to sync a mobile device to a desktop by scaning a QR.
<br>Then we are able to send a picture from the mobile to the desktop session.
<br>It avoids the fastidious Take a pix + "send an email" then upload it from the desktop form. 
<p>

<p>
This is a simple boiler plate. The PHP part is not even necessary.
<br>We use this to show how we can interact with node using a redis PUB/SUB channel
</p>

Refer to the README.md from each parts (php, node and fend) for installation.
